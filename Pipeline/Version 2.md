Here are suggested improvements to Identity Security Fabric Hub :

1. I want to highlt how the ISPM hub can trigger actions into other areas of the Platform. However, for the sake of the Hackathon, i'll not be consumting events to highlight this. As a temporary fix to help judges understand how the entire platform is interconnected, I want to have an arrow appear when my mouse over the "Orphaned Account" use case in the ISPM card. This arrow should be linked to "Automated User Offboarding" under Identity Governance & Administration. 

2. I want to able to generate threats to kickoff certain specific use cases. A colleague of mine build something already. For now, I just want to add a button under Identity Threat Detection & Response called "Generate Threats" that would redirect me to a blank page for now until i receive the code.

3. Add another Button Called "Pipeline View", This is an alternate view. Rather than viewing by use cases, your view of what happened during the demo is via one of the two pipeline (Access or IGA pipeline). The original view we built should be called "Identity Security Fabric view by use cases" and have a button that would redirect to another view called Identity Security Fabrice view by pipeline. 

For both use cases we've demonstrated, we should show highlight each node that is being called upon on the pipeline. For example, a user (ex. test@athena.com) login in, verifying credential, being promoted by MFA and then being logged in.
