# Project Athena

**Live Identity Security Fabric Dashboard** for Okta Solution Engineers

A real-time, interactive dashboard that visualizes Okta's Identity Security Fabric in action during live demos. Built for the Okta Presales Hackathon.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ and npm
- Okta tenant with Event Hooks capability
- GitHub Codespaces (for port forwarding and webhook endpoint)
- Anthropic API key (get from https://console.anthropic.com)

### 1. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
cd server
# Create .env file with your Anthropic API key
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR_KEY_HERE" > .env
echo "MAX_CLAUDE_CALLS_PER_HOUR=100" >> .env
echo "MAX_COST_PER_HOUR=1.00" >> .env
```

### 2. Start the Backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```
Backend runs on port **3001** with WebSocket server active.

### 3. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs on port **5173**. Open http://localhost:5173

### 4. Configure Okta Event Hook (Optional)
To connect to a live Okta tenant:
```bash
# In GitHub Codespaces:
# 1. Backend server must be running on port 3001
# 2. Navigate to "Ports" tab in Codespaces
# 3. Find port 3001 and set visibility to "Public"
# 4. Copy the forwarded URL (e.g., https://xxxx-3001.app.github.dev)

# In Okta Admin Console → Workflow → Event Hooks
# Create Event Hook:
#   URL: https://your-codespace-url-3001.app.github.dev/webhook
#   Events: user.session.start, user.authentication.auth_via_mfa,
#           group.user_membership.add, user.lifecycle.create
```

## 📖 Overview

Project Athena is an interactive dashboard that:
- **Tracks live demos** by listening to Okta Event Hooks in real-time
- **Visualizes the Identity Security Fabric** showing how capabilities interconnect
- **Provides multiple views**: Blue Team (defender), Red Team (attacker), and Pipeline View
- **Simulates attacks** with Red Team Dashboard showing 1st and 3rd party threat detection
- **Shows detailed event logs** for each security checkpoint in the access pipeline
- **Auto-detects use case completion** with AI-powered narratives and business outcome summaries

**Built for:** Okta Internal Presales Hackathon (GenAI for GenARR)
**Timeline:** 1-2 day rapid prototype
**Goal:** "Wow" prospects by showing the power of Okta's unified platform with real-time attack simulation

## 🎯 Use Cases Tracked

### 1. MFA Login (Access Management)
**Okta Events:** `user.session.start` + `user.authentication.auth_via_mfa`

**Pipeline Nodes Activated:**
- Need Access → Present Login → Verify Identity → MFA → Enrich User → Grant Access
- Identity Verification, Breached Password Detection
- Device Posture Checks, Device Assurance

**Business Outcomes:**
- 🔒 **Risk Reduced:** Phishing-resistant authentication
- ⚡ **Productivity Improved:** Fast, seamless login experience

**Event Logs:** Shows MFA challenge sent, validated, device posture evaluated, etc.

### 2. Group Assignment (IGA - Identity Governance)
**Okta Events:** `group.user_membership.add` or `user.lifecycle.create`

**Pipeline Nodes Activated:**
- Need Access → Present Login → Verify Identity → Enrich User → Grant Access
- Identity Verification

**Business Outcomes:**
- ✅ **Efficiency Improved:** Automated provisioning via group membership
- 📊 **Compliance Maintained:** Audit trail of access changes

**Event Logs:** Shows directory sync, group membership update, entitlements recalculated

### ISPM Detections (Security Posture)
- **Partially Offboarded User** - User deprovisioned from some but not all apps
- **Unmanaged Service Account** - Service account without lifecycle management
- **Weak Password Policy** - Policy not meeting security standards
- **Orphaned Account** - Account exists without active ownership (triggers remediation arrow)

---

## 🔄 Demo State Management

The dashboard uses a **timestamp-based gate** to ensure clean demo starts:

1. **Standby Mode** - Dashboard loads with all cards greyed out. Events are received but not processed.
2. **Start Demo** - SE clicks button, `demoStartTime` is recorded. Only events with `published >= demoStartTime` are processed.
3. **Active State** - Events matching use cases trigger card completion with animated checkmarks.
4. **Reset Demo** - Clears all state, sets new timestamp, ready for next demo.

This prevents old/duplicate events from polluting the demo experience.

## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Event Delivery** | Push (Event Hooks) | Real-time, no polling overhead |
| **Event Correlation** | Bidirectional matching | Handles out-of-order event delivery |
| **Log Interpretation** | Pre-written templates | Zero API latency, no LLM costs |
| **TypeScript** | No | Faster iteration for hackathon timeline |
| **State Persistence** | None (in-memory) | POC simplicity, fresh start per demo |
| **Pipeline Diagram** | SVG with React | Scalable, interactive, customizable |
| **Node Inspection** | Click-to-inspect drawer | Non-intrusive, detailed event logs |
| **View Toggle** | React Router | Clean URLs, shareable links |
