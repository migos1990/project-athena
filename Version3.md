Improvements from Version 3

How to Get to 90+ at the Hackathon : 

1. Add AI-powered narration (+5 points)

    Use Claude API to interpret raw events and explain "why this matters"
    Real-time business outcome generation instead of pre-written templates

2. Add 1-2 more live use cases (+3 points)

    ITDR threat detection (not just placeholder)
    To do so, I want to add my friend Git project for this hackathon see : https://github.com/Zantonse/SSF-Transmitter/blob/main/okta-ssf-visual/README.md
